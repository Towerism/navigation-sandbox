* Navigation Sandbox
Demonstrates a navmesh agent able to navigate a simple navmesh consisting of
several navmesh obstacles.
** Scripts
There are two scripts included: =MoveDestination.cs= and
=MoveToClickPoint.cs=. Both allow you to tell the navmesh agent where it should
go.
*** Move Destination
This script allows you to use another game object to determine the destination
of the navmesh. At the start of the scene, the agent will simply navigate to the
location of the specified game object.
*** Move To Click Point
This script is like Move Destination in that you can specify a destination for
the agent, except that you do so by clicking on a point on the floor at runtime.
